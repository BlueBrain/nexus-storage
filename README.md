# Nexus Storage Service

A service to abstract I/O operations on a remote file system, to support Nexus' file management API.

Please visit the [parent project](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus) for more information about Nexus.

## Repository was discontinued

The code has been moved to the [main nexus repository](https://github.com/bluebrain/nexus) as a module
and its development will continue there.

## Build

In the project's top-level directory run:

```shell script
./sbt assembly
```

This outputs a self-contained JAR `nexus-storage.jar`.

## Funding & Acknowledgment

The development of this software was supported by funding to the Blue Brain Project, a research center of the École polytechnique fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL), from the Swiss government's ETH Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.
